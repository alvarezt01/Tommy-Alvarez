				<h4>Personal Profile</h4>
				<p style="float: right; height: 320px; width: 213px; margin-right: 50px"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS1UVFdGEw3ZP0LEymzVaXqVy7xL_si7EOQoFVC3jvnLrLDkn8T"/></p>
				<p style="margin-right: 90px">	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My full name is Tomas Alvarez Alonzo.  I was born on April 30, 1995.  I was raised in Nebraska for most of my life.  My parents
				are Juan Alvarez and Margarita Alonzo.  I have three brothers and three sisters.  I am currently a Junior at Midland University and
				work at Wal Mart.  What I like about my school studies is that the professors are very friendly and make sure students understand the
				material that is needed for each career field.  What I dislike about Midland University is the amount of languages taught for computer
				programming.  In Wal Mart, I enjoy the managers that are very friendly and listen to new ideas that any associate may have.  What I
				dislike is the team I work with are sometimes in a bad mood, but the goal is to change that and see if a smile appears.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My favorite activities include playing soccer, playing the guitar, and experimenting with things on the computer.  I love to do these
				things because I enjoy it, and I also think it is fun.  My favorite color is blue because it reminds me of freedom.  I am clean when
				it comes to places I spend time in, but for me, organization is more important when dealing with computers.
				</p>
				<h4>My Past</h4>
				<p style="Margin-right: 90px">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My childhood was generally positive and this is because I had parents and siblings
				 that were really supportive.  I always found school to be easy and this is because my father always expected straight A's.  My most
				successful day was when I walked across the stage to receive my diploma in High School.  I am the second person who received my diploma in my father's entire family.
				  The peak experience of my teen years was finally traveling to the country I was born in.</p>
				<h4>My Future</h4>
				<p>
					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In my twenties I hope to settle down with my significant other, and I would love to have a job that I enjoy the work and the people.  In
					my thirties I hope to achieve a software creation that is useful to others.  I would love to travel to Barcelona because as a kid I told my self that
					I will go one day.  I think having a career is an achievement that my father would be proud of and I would like to be a computer programmer so that I can
					do what I enjoy.
				</p>
				<h4>My Present</h4>
				<p>
					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am happy when others around me have a smile on their face.  I feel comfortable making mistakes because I learn from them.  I need to learn
					more programming languages.  It is important to keep an active body to have a healthy mind.  I dislike it when people that are lazy try to take advantage
					of the people who are hard workers.  I love when a team works together and achieve something great.  What no one realizes about me is the many abilities I have.  I hope
					 that I could work for a great company when I graduate from Midland University.  Learning is a never-ending activity that should be used in a career and in life.
